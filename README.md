Qaos: Testing with Intent
Standard QA is too predictable. You need Qaos to find the bugs that actually matter.

Qaos (pronounced "Chaos") is a new kind of quality assurance tool. Instead of following a rigid, step-by-step script that breaks the moment a developer changes a button or a layout, Qaos uses reasoning to understand the goal of a test.

The Vision
Most software testing today is "brittle." If you rename a "Buy Now" button to "Checkout," the automated test fails—not because the app is broken, but because the script is stuck in the past.

Qaos changes this. It moves away from "Step-Based Testing" and introduces "Intent-Based Testing." You tell Qaos what you want to achieve, and it figures out the path, adapting to changes in real-time just like a human user would.

How it Works (The Amazon Nova Suite)
Qaos is powered by the Amazon Nova family of AI, which allows it to see, listen, and act within a browser:

The Navigator (Nova Act): This is the engine that actually "drives" the browser. It doesn't look at code; it looks at the website. It can navigate complex menus, fill out forms, and handle multi-step checkouts with human-like reliability.

The Visual Oracle (Multimodal): Qaos has eyes. It can detect if a button is overlapping text, if an image didn't load, or if the layout looks "off" on a mobile screen—things that standard testing tools are blind to.

The Strategist (Nova 2 Lite): This is the brain that plans the "chaos." If it hits an unexpected popup or a redesigned page, it doesn't just quit. it "thinks" of a new way to reach the goal.

The Voice of Quality (Nova 2 Sonic): Provides real-time voice updates. You can literally ask, "Hey Qaos, did the checkout flow pass?" and get an instant, natural response.

Key Benefits
Zero Maintenance
Stop spending hours fixing "flaky" tests. Because Qaos understands the intent (e.g., "Purchase a shirt"), it doesn't care if the button ID changed or the color is different. It just works.

Discover the "Unknown Unknowns"
Qaos acts as an autonomous explorer. It doesn't just follow the "happy path." It tries different combinations and actions to find the weird edge cases and bugs that a human-written script would never think to check.

Visual & Real-World Quality
Most tools only check if a button is "clickable" in the code. Qaos checks if the button is actually visible and usable for a human, ensuring your app doesn't just "work"—it feels right.

Built for the Agentic AI and UI Automation categories, Qaos demonstrates a future where software quality isn't about writing more code, but about giving an intelligent agent the freedom to find the truth.
