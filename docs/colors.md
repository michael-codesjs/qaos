# Qaos Color Palette

## Primary Colors
*   **Dark (Text/UI):** `#111111` (Near Black) - Used for primary headings, the main navigation sidebar, and dark-themed console outputs.
*   **Light (Background):** `#F6F5F3` (Off-white/Beige) - Primary page background for a sophisticated, clean workspace.
*   **Secondary Text:** `#5E5C5A` (Muted Grey) - Used for logs, timestamps, and secondary labels.

## Functional / Agent Colors
These colors map directly to the core AI agents powering Qaos, used to distinguish their actions in the timeline and UI:

*   **The Strategist (Nova 2 Lite):** `#328EFA` (Blue)
    *   *Usage:* Planning phases, decision nodes, high-level reasoning steps.
*   **The Navigator (Nova Act):** `#E16540` (Orange)
    *   *Usage:* Active browser actions (clicks, typing, navigation), movement paths.
*   **The Voice of Quality (Nova 2 Sonic):** `#FBC768` (Yellow)
    *   *Usage:* Spoken feedback, interactive prompts, warnings, or human-in-the-loop requests.
*   **The Visual Oracle (Multimodal):** `#47D096` (Green)
    *   *Usage:* Visual verifications, "Pass" states, layout analysis overlays.

## Gradients & Glows
Used in backgrounds and "Aura" effects to visualize AI activity:
*   **Logic Glow:** `#D0B2FF` (Violet) - Used for The Strategist's thinking state.
*   **Action Glow:** `#FFEED8` (Peach) - Used for The Navigator's active state.
*   **Vision Glow:** `#99FFF9` (Cyan) - Used for The Visual Oracle's scanning state.

## Usage Notes
*   High contrast is key: `#111111` on `#F6F5F3`.
*   Agent colors are used as *accents* (e.g., a thin border on a card, a small icon, or a timeline node color). They should not dominate the UI.
*   Gradients are diffused and soft ("Auras"), never harsh linear gradients.
