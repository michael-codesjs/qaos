# Qaos Branding

## Brand Identity
Qaos (pronounced "Chaos") positions itself as the future of software quality assurance: **Intent-Based Testing**. Unlike brittle, scripted tests, Qaos is an intelligent, autonomous agent that adapts to change. The brand aesthetic communicates intelligence, meaningful chaos, and relentless precision.

## Logo
*   **Icon:** A stylized 'Q' formed by a disrupted circle or a chaotic path converging into a precise point (referencing the transition from chaos to order).
*   **Wordmark:** "qaos" in lowercase, using the custom `Labil Grotesk Variable` font.
*   **Color Usage:**
    *   **White:** On dark backgrounds.
    *   **Black:** On light backgrounds.

## Tone of Voice
*   **Authoritative & Relentless:** Qaos doesn't just "test"; it *finds the truth*. It uncovers the "unknown unknowns."
*   **Futuristic & Adaptive:** Emphasizes AI autonomy ("The Navigator," "The Strategist").
*   **Human-Centric:** Focuses on *user intent* rather than code syntax. "It just works."
*   **Direct:** Clear, concise, and void of fluff.

## Imagery
*   **Illustrations:** Minimalist, "sketch" style vector illustrations in black and white. Concepts: A maze being solved instantly, a magnifying glass revealing hidden cracks, a robot hand navigating a UI.
*   **Product Graphics:** High-fidelity, clean UI mockups of the test runner and dashboard.
    *   **Style:** Card-based layouts with soft, diffused shadows.
    *   **Focus:** Clean data visualization (test paths, success rates) without clutter.
